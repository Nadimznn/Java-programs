Day 1 (23.03.2018)

Java Programming

1. What is Java?

Ans. Java is a High Level Programming Language, That's Originally developed by "Sun Micro-system" but currently owned by "Oracle".
Java is Created by James Gosling "The Father Of Java."

2.Why We should run Java/ Features of Java?

Ans. Here some points:-
i) Platform Based {(WORA)= Write once run AnyWhere}
ii) Object  Oriented
iii)  Support web based Application.
iv) Robust (Error handling)
v) Secure Programming Language.
vi)Multi Threated. 


Some Escape Sequence:-

\b = BackSpace
\t = Tab
\n = new line
\r = Carriage Return
\' = Double quote
\" = Single quote 
\\ = BackSlash


Comment:-
Comments are use for side notes. Comments are ignored by the Compiler.
Blank lines, space, tab, enter, are also ignored. 
Three types of Comment and they are
1. single line comment
\\
2.Multi line comment
/*
*/
3. Documentation comment/** 
 */
Day 1 End. (23.03.2018) (1.20 AM)



Day 2 (24.03.2018)

Uses of Variable?

i) We Can use 4 types of variable and they are Letter(A......Z, a.....z),Digit(0....9), Underscore(_), DollarSign($).
ii) We can't use a number or digit At the first to get a variable name.
iii)Any keyword, function name cant excess to the variable.
iv) There is no space or gap in a variable name.

Variable declaration syntax:-

data_type Variable_Name



Data_Type:=
 1. Primitive
	i)Boolean(boolean)
	ii)Numerical
		a) Character (char)
		b) Integral
		    i)Integer(int, byte, short, long)
			ii) Floating point(float, double)
 2.Non-primitive
   i)String
   ii)Array
   
   
Format Specifier:=

When we print something in program we use "printf" and some format specifier like as

for boolean = %b,
for char = %c,
for integrals= %d,
for floating point = %f.

Day 3 (25.03.2018)

Operator,Operand, Expression

At First we recognize that what is those?

a+b=c (here, 'a' and 'b' is a operand, '+' is a operator, c is a constant, and whole(a+b=c) is called an expression)

Types of Operator

i) Arithmetic Operator
ii) Logical Operator
iii) Assignment Operator
iv) Relational Operator
v) Conditional Operator
vi) Unary Operator
vii) Bitwise Operator
viii) Special Operator


i) Arithmetic Operator:-

(+)=Summation, (-)=Subtraction, (*)=Multiplication, (/)=division, (%)=remainder.

ii)Assignment Operator:-

(=) This is assign Sign.

There are six types of assignment operator....

(=)=Assign, (+=)=Plus assign, (-=)=Minus assign, (*=)= Multiplication assign, (/=)= Division assign, (%=) = Remainder assign.

Day 3 (end)



Day 4 (28.03.2018 Wednesday)

iii)Unary Operator:=
The unary operators operate on a single operand and following are the examples of Unary operators , The increment (++) and 
decrement (--) operators. 
The unary minus (-) operator. The logical not (!) operator.


(+)= Unary Plus;
(-)= Unary Minus;
(++)= Increment;
(--)= Decrement;


Now Increment and Decrement both have two hand, that is-

Prefix and Postfix.

++a or --a is a prefix Increment or Decrement, In lieu of postfix is a++ or a--. 



iv)Relational Operator:

In computer science, a relational operator is a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of 
relation between two entities.
These include numerical equality (e.g., 5 = 5) and inequalities (e.g., 4 â‰¥ 3).

There are six types of relational operators-

1. > (Greater Than)
2. < (Less than)
3. >= (grater than or equal)
4. <= (Less than or equal)
5. == (Equal Equal)
6. != (Not equal)
 
Day 4 end(28.03.2018  5.30 Am)



Day 5 (29.03.2018 Thursday)

Statement-
Any meaningful expression is called a statements. Ex. x=10;



Control Statement-
i)Selection(if, if else, Switch)
ii)Looping/Iteration(for, While, Do while)
iii)Jump(Break, continue, return)

Even And Odd Method (Formula)

For even = (Number%2==0) Then We get the output is Even. Otherwise,
For Odd = (number%2==1) We get the output is odd.

#Task for Today-
1. Vowel Consonant
2.Capital Small
3.Maximum or minimum
4.Leap year
5.pass/fail

Logical Operator-
A logical operation is a special symbol or word which connects two or more phrases of information. It is most often used to 
test whether a certain.
 
relationship between the phrases is true or false.

Symbol-
&& = Logical and
|| = Logical Or
! = Logical Not

Switch-
Switch is a one kind of Control statements.
*Switch statement provides a better alternative than large series of if-else if statements.
*Switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions.
*keywords = (switch, case, break, default)


Conditional Operator-
Conditional Operator is called by Ternary Operator. Because Of it's three expressions.

Symbol = (?, : )

Syntax ( Expression1?expression2:expression3)

Day 5 End (29.03.2018  6.15am)



Day 6 (31.03.2018 Saturday)

Math Class--
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html For Searching the Math Class.

Syntax-

Math.(Object

Day6 end



Day 7 (01.04.2018 Saturday)

Looping/Iteration

Loop:-
A loop statements allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

For Loop Syntax
for (initialization;Condition;increment/decrement)

ex: for(i=1;i<5;i++)
    {
	Statements
     }

While Loop:-

Syntax-
initialization;
while(condition)	 
{
statements;
increment/decrement;

DoWhile loop:-

Syntax-
initialization;
do{
statements;
increment/decrement;
}
while(condition);

The main difference between while and do-while loop;
Do-while loop execute at least one time if the condition is false, but while loop not.


Jump control statement(Break, Continue)

Break:-
This statement use for break loop or switch statement. It works for only inner loop.

syntax-
break;

Continue:-
Continue statement skips the current iteration for a loop;(for,while,do-while)

Syntax-
continue;


Code templates...

Anything of programming can be templates....just write anything and cut this then go to tools, then options and finally we find
the code templates options.

Day 7 end(01.04.2018 3.12 am)


Day 8 start(22.05.2018)

Series=>

In this lesson we know how to write a Fibonacci series program, like as....
i) 1+2+3+....+n;
ii) 1+3+5+7+.....n;
iii) 1^2+2^2+3^2+.....n^2;
iv)1*2*3*....*n;
etc.


 Factorial:-
 
 5!= 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
 
 Formula:- fact=fact*i using for loop {for(i=n;i<=n;i--)} so this is decrement operator.
